# Project Overview

### This game operates by usage of different methods and switch statements to ensure that user choices are stored and the game functions properly.

### The game begins after the player decides to deal cards.

#### How to Play:

1. If the user chooses to deal the cards, then the cards dealt will be shown with the value of them. Only the dealer's face up card will be displayed instead of all those in the dealer's hand.
2. Based upon the results of the deal, the player will be allowed to hit (have more cards dealt) or stay(stick with the cards in their hands).

*I have learned the importance of establishing the relationships between each class through the usage of a UML to ensure proper functioning.
