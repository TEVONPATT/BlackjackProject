# Project Overview

## This game operates by usage of different methods and switch statements to ensure that user choices are stored and the game functions properly.

## 1. The user is prompted to choose whether they would like to play the game or not.
## 2. The user chooses to have the cards dealt.
## 3. If the user chooses to deal the cards, then the cards dealt will be shown with the value of them
* The dealer's face up card will be displayed
## 4. Based upon results of the deal, the player will be allowed to hit (have more cards dealt) or stay. 

## I have learned the importance of establishing the relationships between each class through the usage of a UML to ensure proper functioning.
